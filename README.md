## Parkinson's Disease Detection via Voice Analysis
This repository contains the source code, datasets, and documentation for developing a neural network designed to detect Parkinson's disease through voice analysis. The project aims to:

Early Detection: Apply machine learning techniques to identify early signs of Parkinson's by analyzing vocal characteristics.
Collaborative Research: Provide tools and datasets that researchers and professionals in healthcare and technology can explore and enhance.
Clinical Application: Develop a support system to assist in screening and monitoring patients, contributing to faster and more accurate diagnoses.
What's Inside

ðŸ”¹ Source Code â€“ Scripts and modules for audio pre-processing, feature extraction, and building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

ðŸ”¹ Datasets â€“ Anonymized and pre-processed voice data from individuals with and without Parkinson's disease.

ðŸ”¹ Documentation â€“ Setup guides, experiment instructions, and contribution guidelines.

ðŸ”¹ Results & Metrics â€“ Model performance analyses to drive continuous improvement and further research.

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the project, test new approaches, and advance the intersection of technology and healthcare for social impact.
